title: people-focused developer & designer

I create web experiences that are thoughtfully designed for everyone involved—from intuitive interfaces for users, easy-to-read code for teammates, and clear priorities for business managers.

My primary project is launching my app Imaginarie (previously Mindy’s Imagination), but I’m also available for freelance work. In my previous career, I worked at Google solving user issues with empathy, communication, and gorgeous spreadsheets.

I’m based in Berkeley, CA where you can find me adding to my fun fact repertoire with a constant stream of podcasts, cooking over-complicated dinners, and, yes, brewing my own kombucha.
